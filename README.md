# üìöüìñ Library Management System - Sorting by Title

## Exercise Description  
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple Java system to manage a collection of books within a library. You will create three classes: `Book`, `Library`, and `LibraryManagerTest`. The system allows adding, retrieving, inserting, and removing books while keeping the list alphabetically ordered by title.

### Requirements:
- Create a `Book` class with a title attribute.
- Create a `Library` class that manages a list of books.
- Ensure that:
  - Books can be added to the collection.
  - The entire book list can be retrieved.
  - A book title can be retrieved by its position.
  - A book can be inserted at a specific position.
  - A book can be removed by title.
  - The list remains alphabetically sorted.
  - Duplicated book titles are not allowed.
- Create a `LibraryManagerTest` class using JUnit to verify all functionalities.

### Methods Implemented:
- `addBook(Book book)`
- `getBooks()`
- `getBookTitleAt(int index)`
- `addBookAt(Book book, int index)`
- `removeBookByTitle(String title)`

## üíª Technologies Used
- Java 17  
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)  
- JUnit 5  
- Maven or Gradle (optional, based on setup)

## üìã Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 installed  
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition  
- Git (optional, for version control)  
- Maven or Gradle configured (if using dependency management)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Required Tools
- **Java JDK 17**: [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html)  
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**: [Download IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)  
- **Maven or Gradle** (optional): Install your preferred build tool if required.

### 2. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you are using version control:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArnauAsole/S1.04.Testing.Lv1.git
cd ArnauAsole/S1.04.Testing.Lv1/
```

3. Open the Project
Open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File ‚Üí Open and selecting the root directory of your project.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project
To run the application:

Open the LibraryManagerTest.java file.

Right-click and select Run or use the green arrow to execute the JUnit tests.

All test cases should pass, verifying the correct behavior of the system.

You will see JUnit test results such as:

java

‚úì testBookListIsNotNull
‚úì testBookListSizeAfterAdding
‚úì testBookAtSpecificPosition
‚úì testNoDuplicateTitles
‚úì testGetBookTitleAtSpecificPosition
‚úì testAddBookAtSpecificPosition
‚úì testRemoveBookReducesSize
‚úì testBooksRemainAlphabeticallySorted
üåê Deployment
This is a console-based Java project intended for local execution in your IDE. No deployment is required.
